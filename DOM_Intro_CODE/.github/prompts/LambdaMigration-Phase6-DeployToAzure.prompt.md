Deploy resources to Azure

# Azure Deployment Guide - Best Practices

Deploy my Azure Function from the current workspace to Azure. Follow these steps:
- Use azure_development-get_deployment_best_practices to get high level instructions to follow.
- Use azure_bicep_schemas-get_bicep_resource_schema to help create the infrastructure as code files for Azure resources.
- Create the necessary bicep infrastructure files in the infra/ folder for the Azure resources to deploy.
- Use azure_check_predeploy to check for the infrastructure files and fix issues accordingly.
- Use azure_check_quota and azure_check_region to ensure the Azure resources can be deployed to the target region.
- Use azure_azd-up_deploy to deploy the Azure resources from the infrastructure files.
- Use azure_get_azd_app_logs to track the deployment progress and ensure it is successful. Report any issues as you discover them.
- If the deployment is successful, provide a summary of the deployed Azure resources. If it's a failure, provide general guidance on how to troubleshoot.


## Deployment Approach

This project uses Azure Developer CLI (azd) for deployment. The azd tool streamlines the deployment process by handling infrastructure provisioning, application building, and deployment in a single command.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, ensure:
- You have the latest Azure CLI and Azure Developer CLI installed
- You are logged in to Azure (`az login`)
- You have selected the correct subscription (`az account set --subscription < subscription - id > `)
- Your infrastructure files in the `infra / ` folder are correctly set up and validated
- Your application code is ready for deployment

## Infrastructure Deployment Best Practices

Our infrastructure follows these principles:
- Uses AVM (Azure Verified Modules) for consistent, secure resource deployment
- Implements modular Bicep files organized by resource type
- Applies least-privilege RBAC with dedicated modules
- Uses managed identities for secure service-to-service authentication
- Configures proper monitoring with Application Insights and Log Analytics

## Deployment Steps

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Initialize azd environment
   azd init

   # or use an existing environment
   azd env select < environment - name >

    At the end, generate a deployment summary report in the reports folder.
        Also, update the status report file with the status of the deployment step.
   ```
